Release Master
=============

**As a release master I want to automate Drush Make builds with Build Manager,
before deploying new stable releases to production.**

This chapter covers:
  * [Directory structure](release-master/directory-structure.html): An
    explanation of how _rhymessite's directory structure minimizes friction and
    headaches for maintainers and contributors
  * [Pre-build steps](release-master/prebuild.html): Steps to prep a release
  * [Build steps](release-master/build.html): Steps to (re)build a code base
    from a make file
  * [Post-build steps](release-master/postbuild.html): Steps to restore private
    stuff after a Drush Make build
  * [Automated build](release-master/automated-build.html): Automate production
    builds with Drush Subtree and Build Manager
