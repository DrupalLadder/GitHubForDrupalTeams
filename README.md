A Git Workflow for Drupal Site Development
==========================================

[![Screen](https://raw.github.com/path/to/github-drupal.png)]

Example developer user stories and workflows for working with [Build
Manager](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/buildmanager)
and [Drush Subtree](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/drushsubtree).

Chapters included in this GitBook follow the user stories below:

 * **As a Drupal developer** I want to set up a local development environment for
   fast, easy, frictionless web development.
 * **As a site developer** I want to use GitHub to collaborate with my peers on
   Drupal development.
 * **As a project maintainer** I want to work on my projects inside site
   repositories, then push changes out of my site repo up to drupal.org (or
   GitHub, or wherever), and to pull work from drupal.org (or GitHub or
   wherever) into my site repo.
 * **As a release master** I want to automate Drush Make builds with Build Manager,
   before deploying new stable releases to production.

These are hands-on examples. You'll need a GitHub user account to follow along.
