Site Developer: Resolve merge conflicts
---------------------------------------

Being able to resolve merge conflicts is critical to being able to collaborate
effectively with other developers. There's nothing about this workflow that's
different for a collaborative workflow versus an individual person working in a
single repo, so it's beyond the scope of the examples included here. If you've
gotten by using Git without mastering conflict resolution, now is the time to
figure it out. Git's documentation is a great place to start:

Open up the documentation:

      git merge --help

Then take a look at these sections of merge documentation:

  - HOW CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED
  - HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS
  - EXAMPLES

There are a number of different tools (command line and GUI) for visualizing and
resolving merge conflicts. Google around. Find a tool you like.
