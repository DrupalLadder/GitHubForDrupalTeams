Site Developer
==============

---
### As a site developer, I want to use GitHub to collaborate with my peers on Drupal development.
---

This chapter walks through:
* [Site setup](site-setup.html): Clone an [Acquia Cloud] site repo and get it
  set up for local development.
* [Fork](fork.html): Create a personal "fork" of the site repo on GitHub, for
  backing up development work and collaborating it with others.
* [Pull request](pull-request.html): Submit finished work for peer review as a "pull request".
* [Rebase](rebase.html): Update a branch that's behind the the main project, by
  rebasing.
* [Interactive Rebase](rebase-interactive.html): Tidy up a messy commit log
  before submitting a pull request.
