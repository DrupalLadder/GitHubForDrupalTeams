Site Developer: Pull request
----------------------------

Submit your work for peer review as a "pull request".

Your changes currently live here:
https://github.com/<your-username>/_rhymessite

You want to submit your work for peer review, to be merged into the Drupal
Ladder's master branch here:
https://github.com/drupalladder/_rhymessite

To do this, submit a pull request. Follow the instructions on GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
Use the select list to tell GitHub you want to submit the pull request from
<my-user-name>/my-new-rhyme to drupalladder/master.

Pull requests are extremely useful for peer review. To get familiar with pull requests:

    - Comment on a line of code
    - Comment on an entire commit

    at once
