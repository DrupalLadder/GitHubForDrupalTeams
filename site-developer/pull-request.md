Site Developer: Pull request
----------------------------

Submit your work for peer review as a "pull request".

Your changes currently live here:
https://github.com/username/RhymesSite

You want to submit your work for peer review, to be merged into the Drupal
Ladder's master branch here:
https://github.com/drupalladder/RhymesSite

In GitHub lingo, a request to merge changes from one user's branch into
another user's branch is called a "pull request".

1. Create a pull request.

    Follow GitHub's instructions for submitting a pull request here:
    https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request

    Tip: When you submit your pull request, be sure to submit your pull request
    from and to here:

    FROM: username/my-new-rhyme

    TO: drupalladder/master

1. Peer review.

    Ask a someone else to find your pull request here:
    https://github.com/drupalladder/rhymessite/pulls

    Try all these different handy tricks for code reviewing someone's pull
    request and providing feedback:

    - Find your pull request here: github.com/drupalladder/RhymesSite/pulls
    - Use GitHub's GUI to review the pull request commit-by-commit
      - Comment on a line of code
      - Comment on an entire commit
    - Use GitHub's GUI to review all the files changed in their final state, all
      at once
      - Comment on a line of code
      - Comment on the entire pull request
    - Find GitHub indicators about the status of the pull request you're
      looking at:
      - Is the pull request open or closed? (see
        https://github.com/drupalladder/RhymesSite/pulls)
      - Can this pull request be merged automatically? (See
        https://github.com/drupalladder/RhymesSite/pull/<number>, is the button
        at the bottom gray or green? If it's green, there will be no merge
        conflicts and you can merge throught the GUI if you want. If it's gray,
        GitHub anticipates conflicts, which must be resolved locally before you
        merge.)
