Project Maintainer
==================

---
### As a project maintainer I want to work on my projects inside site repositories, then push changes out of my site repo up to drupal.org (or GitHub, or wherever), and to pull work from drupal.org (or GitHub or wherever) into my site repo.
---

This chapter walks through:
  * [Git subtree pull](project-maintainer/git-subtree-pull.html): Pull changes
    from an individual project repo (module, theme, etc.) into a site repo.
  * [Git subtree push](project-maintainer/git-subtree-push.html): Push changes
    from a site repo to an individual project repo.
  * [Drush subtree](project-maintainer/drushsubtree.html): Use [Drush Subtree](https://github.com/WhiteHouse/drushsubtree)
    to simplify git subtree workflows.
