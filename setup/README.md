Setup

### As a Drupal developer I want to set up a local development environment for fast, easy, frictionless web development.
---

This chapter walks through:
- [Basic setup](basic.html): Stuff any site developer needs to do to get up and
  running with local development.
- [Advanced setup](advanced.html): Advanced setup for project maintainers and
  release masters.
- [Directory structure](directory-overview.html): Organize site repos to
  minimize friction for local development and future maintenance.
